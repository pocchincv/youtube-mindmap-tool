# Speech-to-Text Services Integration

## Description
Implement multiple Speech-to-Text (STT) service integrations including OpenAI API, Google API, local Whisper, and Breeze-ASR-25 to extract transcripts from YouTube videos with precise timestamps.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OpenAI Whisper API integration with timestamp extraction
- [ ] Google Speech-to-Text API integration with timestamp support
- [ ] Local Whisper model integration for offline processing
- [ ] Breeze-ASR-25 integration for advanced ASR capabilities
- [ ] Audio extraction from YouTube videos (using yt-dlp or similar)
- [ ] Configurable STT service selection per user preference
- [ ] Fallback mechanism when primary STT service fails
- [ ] Timestamp accuracy validation and alignment
- [ ] Progress tracking for long video processing
- [ ] Queue system for batch processing of multiple videos
- [ ] Cost estimation and tracking for paid STT services
- [ ] Language detection and multi-language support

## Technical Requirements

### STT Service APIs:
```
/**
* OpenAI Whisper STT Processing
* Process audio using OpenAI Whisper API with timestamps
* Input Parameters: audio_file (blob), language (string, optional)
* Return Parameters: Transcript object with timestamped segments
* URL Address: /api/stt/openai/process
* Request Method: POST
**/

/**
* Google Speech-to-Text Processing
* Process audio using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
* Input Parameters: audio_file (blob), config (object)
* Return Parameters: Transcript object with timestamped segments  
* URL Address: /api/stt/google/process
* Request Method: POST
**/

/**
* Local Whisper Processing
* Process audio using local Whisper model installation
* Input Parameters: audio_file (blob), model_size (string)
* Return Parameters: Transcript object with timestamped segments
* URL Address: /api/stt/local/process
* Request Method: POST
**/

/**
* STT Service Status Check
* Check availability and health of all STT services
* Input Parameters: None
* Return Parameters: ServiceStatus object with availability flags
* URL Address: /api/stt/status
* Request Method: GET
**/
```

### Audio Processing Pipeline:
1. Extract audio from YouTube video (MP3/WAV format)
2. Audio preprocessing (noise reduction, normalization)
3. Segment audio for optimal STT processing
4. Process through selected STT service
5. Post-process timestamps and text alignment
6. Store transcript with video synchronization data

### Mock Data System:
- Pre-processed transcript samples for development
- Configurable mock processing times
- Sample audio files for testing different scenarios

## Definition of Done
- All four STT services integrated and functional
- Audio extraction pipeline working reliably
- Timestamp accuracy within acceptable margin (<1 second)
- Service fallback mechanism tested
- Processing queue handles concurrent requests
- Cost tracking implemented for paid services
- Mock data system supports offline development
- Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
