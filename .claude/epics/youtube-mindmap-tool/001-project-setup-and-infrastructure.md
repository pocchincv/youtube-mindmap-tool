# Project Setup and Infrastructure Foundation

## Description
Set up the foundational project structure with the specified technology stack (React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind for frontend, Python + FastAPI for backend) and establish the development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React + Vite + TypeScript project initialized with proper configuration
- [ ] Tailwind CSS integrated and configured
- [ ] FastAPI backend project structure created
- [ ] Database solution selected and configured (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production)
- [ ] Environment configuration files set up (.env, .env.local, etc.)
- [ ] Package management configured (npm/yarn for frontend, pip/poetry for backend)
- [ ] Basic project documentation created (README, setup instructions)
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore files
- [ ] Development scripts configured (start, build, test commands)
- [ ] Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configured for local development

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React 18+ with Vite 4+, TypeScript 5+, Tailwind CSS 3+
- Backend: FastAPI 0.100+, Python 3.11+
- Database: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- Package managers: npm/yarn for frontend, pip for backend
- Development environment: Hot reload enabled for both frontend and backend

## API Documentation Standard
All interfaces must follow the specification:
```
/**
* Interface Name
* Function Description  
* Input Parameters
* Return Parameters
* URL Address
* Request Method
**/
```

## Definition of Done
- Both frontend and backend servers can be started and communicate
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Database connection is established
- All dependencies are documented
- Project structure follows best practices
- Development workflow is documented
